<p>The Museum of Modern Art

Located in the heart of midtown Manhattan, The Museum of Modern Art is home to an unparalleled collection of modern and contemporary art—from Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night and Pablo Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon to cutting-edge photography, film, design, and performance.

Before you visit, be sure to take a look at the helpful tips below, and see additional information about accessibility, visiting with a family, audio guides, dining at the Museum, the MoMA Design Stores, and more. You can also download our MoMA Audio app. See our policies for information about checkrooms, photography, and strollers.

Don’t forget to check out the exhibitions and collection works on view, and what events and film screenings you can catch during your visit. Please note that the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden closes during inclement weather.
Ticketing and wait times

    During the Museum’s building project, please enter at 18 West 54th Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues.

Purchase your tickets online and skip the line! Audio desk lines can also be avoided by using your own mobile device. The line to purchase general admission tickets is usually longest when MoMA opens, so consider arriving after 11:30 a.m. On Friday afternoons, the line for UNIQLO Free Friday Night tickets can also be long, so consider arriving after 6:00 p.m.
Parking

There are a number of parking structures near the Museum, and some offer special rates for visitors.
MoMA PS1

See experimental art and work by emerging artists, including exhibitions, performances, and music, at MoMA PS1, The Museum of Modern Art’s affiliate in Queens. Visit for free within 14 days of your MoMA admission purchase (except Saturdays, July–August). See our policies for information about checkrooms, strollers, and photography.
Shopping

Artbook @ MoMA PS1 offers a broad selection of books on contemporary art, theory, photography, performance, music, and new media—including new and out-of-print volumes, zines, and more.
Restaurant

M. Wells Dinette is a cafeteria-style restaurant by Hugue Dufour and Sarah Obraitis that pays homage to MoMA PS1’s former identity as a schoolhouse by offering communal tables and a perpetually changing menu. Museum admission is not required for entry.
Accessibility

MoMA PS1’s public entrance on Jackson Avenue is accessible by ramp. Wheelchairs are available free of charge in the coat check on a first-come, first-served basis. The three main floors of the museum, including the bookstore and café, are accessible by elevator. For elevator access to the basement, please ask for assistance at the information desk in the lobby area. Wheelchair-accessible bathrooms are located on floors 1, 2, and 3. For more information, or to notify our staff of any special needs, please call the front desk during regular public hours at (718) 784-2085.
